# Project Overview
description: "AI-powered music transcription tool for choir education. Takes any music source and breaks it down into vocal parts with solfa notation for easy choir learning."

problem_statement: |
  Choirs need songs broken down into individual vocal parts (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) with solfa notation (do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do). 
  This currently requires musical expertise and hours of manual work. Many choirs don't have people with this skill.

solution_summary: |
  AI-powered music transcription and breakdown tool that:
  - Takes music from any source (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, upload)
  - Automatically analyzes and breaks down the song
  - Outputs individual vocal parts with solfa notation
  - Generates sheet music/PDFs
